**Solution Approach:**

The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, We establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patientâ€™s chest X-rays to distinguish whether they have a bacterial or viral pneumonia. Our framework utilizes transfer learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches.
